This is MazBotV4 release 0.2.0

This is first really testable release of MazBotV4 engine. It has been developed on Linux x86 machine, and should work on x86 linux.
I guess it should be quite easily portable to x86_64 linux machines, but I do not have a HW for that. 
For other but x86 and x86_64 architectures some inline asm should be rewritten. 

Making a windows port might not be that troublesome, but I've no windows, or windows coding skills. :)

For compiling info see COMPILING.txt

Contents:
Rel 0.1 contents + following:

1. MazBotPseudoXml based configuration system.
	Support for configuring:
	Bot name.
	Servers.
	Channels.
	Events.
	Users.

2. User storage for user maintenance.
	Limitations:
		-There's no mean to add/remove users on the fly. All user configurations must be given in config script.
		-User identification supports only plaintext password mode.
		-User identification cannot handle nick changes, kicks etc. It only updates storage based on joins, parts and quits.

3. "upperlayer" for binding the given configurations to actions on IRC.
	Limitations:
		-There's no support for wildcards in events.
		-There's no support for making the bot to include triggerer's nick, or channel or ... in default replies.
		-There's no support for web events.

4. C callback registration interface. 
	Limitations:
		-There's no mean to interact with IRC using C callbacks. Will be included in 0.2.1 release.

5. Documentation in example files...
	Limitations:
		-Documentation is pretty much inexisting.. Some should be written in near future.
