Compiling release 0.2.0 / tests:

1. edit MazBot/tests/make/Makefile by enabling compiling of wanted test source file (only one source can be enabled at a time!).
	The release is compiled by selecting file irc_cfg_test.c (NOT botV02.c !!!!)
2. go to MazBot/make folder
3. type make clean
4. type make all

To run the bot:
5. go to folder MazBot/test/exe
6. run ./TestExe <config_file_name> <printing options>
	If no options are given, config file "irc_test_cfg.txt" is assumed. 
	If any options are given, first is always assumed to be the name of the config file.
